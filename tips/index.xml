      <description>Computer setup  Vishvas suggests: Some Arch Linux flavor (eg. Manjaro). Then install packages suggested in dyuganga-aur.  Public file distribution  archive.org github releases  File transfers: Dropbox, GDrive, WeTransfer
Video/ audio conferencing, screen sharing
 zoom.us - good quality, wide device coverage. whatsapp calls - occasionally bad quality  Project tracking
 trello.com - list tasks (assignable, can specify due date, can track activity), allow private boards  Remote collaborative coding  github - very popular, supports releases, issue tracking etc.</description>

      <description>Why open source? For us to rapidly achieve our dreams, it is important that we are able to rapidly build on each other’ work, without unnecessary duplication of effort. For this reason open source software and freely available data are important.
Of course, non-community based, closed source software and restricted data are very valuable and useful to end users (eg spokensanskrit.de), but a previous attempt tells me that it can be difficult/ slow to elicit cooperation/ responsiveness when it comes to building on that work.</description>

      <description>Intro  People periodically enquire: &amp;ldquo;Request someone to guide me on: What I have to learn and what I can contribute.&amp;rdquo; Most such people end up contributing nothing despite getting fair project ideas. But some do! We hope some of those will contribute and share good open source code (perfection not required, WIP is fine). This page seeks to address such enquiries more concisely.  Contribute to existing open source projects First find a project / team which fits you.</description>

      <description>[ Culled from emails by shreevatsa and anubhav. ]
General tips  Detailed information  You canread thisor the introductionsection hereto get a rough understanding of the issues involved, as I mentioned before onthis mailing list here.] Handling text correctly Getting Unicode right in Python   When programming in Python, always remain aware of whether a particular object is &amp;ldquo;unicode&amp;rdquo; (code points) or &amp;ldquo;str&amp;rdquo; (bytes).  Basically, Unicode code points logically represent a character (like &amp;ldquo;092E: DEVANAGARI LETTER MA&amp;rdquo;), independent of encoding.</description>
