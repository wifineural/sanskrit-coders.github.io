      <description>Why podcasting?  Listening to stuff is easier. Several people (such as myself) might prefer to listen to audio books and listen to lectures (perhaps during long walks or commutes) rather than read or watch them. There are many popular tools in a variety of platforms to subscribe and listen to podcasts (see subscription guide SB16.). (I use Doggcatcher paid on Android). It turns out to be easier to listen to audio files in this way without the chores such as manual downloads and checking for updates.</description>
